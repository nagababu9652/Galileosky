# Galileosky

The naming conversion was little bit odd. So I am mentioning this.

In src directory

      1. main :- contain code

          a. protobut :- contain the proto's for generating the case classes
          
          b. scala/test :- contains the actual galileosky logical code
          
       2. test :- contains the unit testing code part for a single record
       
       
       
Note: iot_decoderService.scala and iot_decoderServer.scala was not implemented yet
