# Galileosky

The naming conversion was little bit odd. So I am mentioning this.

In src 1. main :- contain actual source code
          a. protobut :- contain the proto's for generating the case classes
          b. scala/test :- contains the actual galileosky logical code
       2. test :- contains the unit testing code part for a single record
